# Ruggability - know the risks before it's too late

## Motivation

The combined factors of anonymity, 6+ figures of cash and transaction finality provide unprecedented incentives for scammers of all sorts to run away with your money. There's therefore no surprise that every week we [witness](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?theme=rugPull) new massive rug pulls.

This website is an attempt to uncover the different centralization and permission threats that exist in different Web3 projects. Armed with knowledge, investors and speculators can choose where to pour their funds fully understanding the risks involved.

## Format

Each project will be described using several metrics:

1.  Anonymity - are key project members anonymous?
2.  Contract upgradeability - How easily can the project "change the rules" by upgrading proxy contracts
3.  Asset risk - are special addresses permitted to handle user's assets?
4.  Multisig - Is the owner address a multisig smart wallet? Only applicable to dangerous operations
5.  Timelock - Is there a lock time period before any dangerous protocol operation?
6.  Additional - Threats not handled by the above metrics go here. For example, for stablecoins, is the backing strategy adequate? What are possible pitfalls?
